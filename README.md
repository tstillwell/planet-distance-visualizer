# Planetary distance visualizer #

A scale model of our solar system
built for the browser with javascript.

Visualizes the scale of interplanetary space
using idealized (not realistic) orbits for each of the
8 planets. Planet distances used are average distance.

Clicking a planet name in the overlay will make
the camera look at that planet.
